# Underwater Cybersecurity Research 

This repository contains my research paper titled “Security Challenges in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT)”, completed as part of my studies at SLIIT. It was awarded an exceptional peer-review score of 99.33/100 🌟

## Abstract

With 71% of Earth covered in water, securing underwater communication is vital. This research dives into the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) and its security threats—specifically in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs). 

It addresses:

- 🕳️ Wormhole, 👤 Sybil, 🕳️ Sinkhole attacks  
- 🚫 Denial of Service (DoS): Jamming, Flooding, Spoofing  
- 🔐 Cryptography, key management, and digital signatures  
- ⚡ Energy-efficient and ML-powered intrusion detection models  
- 📡 Secure routing, localization & data aggregation algorithms

## Why It Matters

IoUT supports critical applications in:
- 🌊 Ocean environment monitoring
- 🧪 Underwater research
- 🛰️ Military surveillance & mine detection
- 🌪️ Natural disaster prevention (tsunami/flood sensors)

## Achievements

- Peer-reviewed score: 99.33/100
- Proposed solutions applicable to future underwater security standards
- Suggested energy-harvesting and real-world experimentation approaches
